My First Project: Random Joke Generator üÉè
For my first project, I created a simple web application using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The project utilizes an API that provides random jokes, allowing users to enjoy a good laugh with just a click of a button.

Technologies Used:
JavaScript: Used to fetch data from the API and handle user interactions.
CSS: Used for styling to give the project a visually appealing look.
HTML: Used for the structure and content of the web page.
Features:
Random Joke Generation: The application fetches random jokes from the API and displays them on the web page.
Button for New Jokes: Users can click a button to fetch and display a new joke without refreshing the page.
Responsive Design: The web page is designed to be responsive, ensuring a good user experience across various devices.
How to Use:
Visit the Random Joke Generator (replace "#" with the link to your project).
Click the "Get Joke" button to display a random joke.
Enjoy a good laugh!
Future Improvements:
Add more features such as category-specific jokes or the ability to share jokes on social media.
Improve the user interface with additional styling and animations.
This project was a great learning experience for me, allowing me to apply my knowledge of frontend technologies and interact with an external API. I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills with future projects!
